All visual assets (including dragon models, landscapes, skyboxes, and UI icons) are recorded from the game **Day of Dragons**, developed by **Beawesome Games**.  
The videos were captured using **NVIDIA GeForce Experience** directly from a released copy of Day of Dragons.

All rights to the following belong to **Beawesome Games**:

- The Forgotten Forest map and other environment assets  
- Any visual elements derived from Day of Dragons
